Just hit refresh to get the latest updates!

10:36 AM &#8211; Roll another video. That is it! Our big headlines are:

  * Crazy whiteboard feature! This was simply amazing to see. Basically, throw a USB Content Camera in front of the whiteboard and capture old school white boards into Teams.
  * The ability to go from 4 streams to 9 streams in a video feed is pretty cool.
  * Background blur is expanded to include background replace.
  * Private Channels

10:34 AM &#8211; Roll the video. Lots and lots of devices.

10:32 AM &#8211; We are now talking about SfB to Teams migration. They are reminding everyone that Meetings First is now available. I will have much more on this and make sure to check out previous posts.

We are chatting about migrating the internal Microsoft company. MS did it all in 4 months. 

10:26 AM &#8211; Now we are showing off proximity join for meetings. This is pretty awesome. Basically, you walk into a room and it will auto join. Also, we are getting a first look at Microsoft Whiteboard.<figure class="wp-block-image">

Touch screens are coming! Also, content capture camera support is coming! This is crazy! This includes the ability to see through the person when they are standing in front of the white board.<figure class="wp-block-image">

10:22 AM &#8211; A new real time captions meeting. This is pretty awesome! You can also do fancy stuff like swapping backgrounds to pictures. This is in addition to the ability to blur backgrounds.<figure class="wp-block-image">

10:20 AM &#8211; It&#8217;s meeting time. We are going to start with Live Meetings. First demo is showing off real time (or on-demand) transcriptions from one language to another.

Announcement: Live Events is now GA.

10:16 AM &#8211; We are now looking at Shifts. If you have never seen it before it&#8217;s pretty fancy. We are now seeing a camera update but the stage is SO DARK the camera isn&#8217;t working.

Looking at praise right now. It&#8217;s fancy stickers for users. They are also showing off the First Line Configuration page. A shout out to Healthcare and Education with features already showed.

10:14 AM &#8211; We are now seeing the new calendar experience. I can tell you it&#8217;s a calendar. It even has dates on it.

We are also talking about some basic calling features of Teams. Nothing new is being announced here it appears. 

10:11 AM &#8211; We are showing off something brand new! Private Channels are coming to TEAMS! This is coming later this year.

10:00 AM &#8211; We are starting! First big announcement is that Teams is now used by over 500,000 organizations. [EDIT: Typing fast&#8230;not 500 million &#8211; slight difference. ðŸ™‚ ]
