I had to hold off on pushing the GO BUTTON on this post because I knew something was releasing on Monday and I figured if I posted it on Friday someone from Microsoft would come a knocking!

**It&#8217;s Time To Upgrade**

Skype for Business 2019 is now released and available for EVERYONE to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Skype-for-Business-Blog/Skype-for-Busienss-Server-2019-now-GA/ba-p/276439" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a>.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have the last few months testing it out.  Although there isn&#8217;t a lot in this build the upcoming CU&#8217;s are going to #EPIC.

**Update x 2**

Yep, <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2018/10/22/exchange-server-2019-now-available/?WT.mc_id=Social-Twitter-phschmit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exchange 2019 </a>is released now as well.  There appears to be A LOT more cool features in Exchange 2019 vs Skype for Business.  I wonder which one has a larger on-premises install base at this point in time.

**Mac Update**

Using <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/follow-the-latest-updates-in-skype-for-business-cece9f93-add1-4d93-9a38-56cc598e5781?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US#OS_Type=Windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skype for Business on Mac</a>, then it&#8217;s time to hit the update button.  The big feature: Emoji Support!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1694" src="https://masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Untitled.png?resize=362%2C175&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="362" height="175" /> 

Just kidding&#8230;Skype for Business on Mac now supports the Teams Only upgrade path.

**Teams Training**

If you missed Microsoft&#8217;s announcement, there is now <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/instructor-led-training-teams-landing-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live-instructor led trainings</a> that are available to all organizations.  Make sure to go sign up your trainers.  Some good stuff here!

**Teams Missing Features**

Tom Arbuthnot has a great <a href="http://tomtalks.uk/2018/10/5-microsoft-teams-features-being-worked-on-that-im-looking-forward-to-5-more-i-think-you-should-vote-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article </a>about Users Voice and some features that are desperately needed.  Some of it is so basic you have to wonder why it&#8217;s taken so long.  So if you want to check out some stuff go look at the article.

**Teams Compact Chat**

So I have to say, this seems almost too easy.  If you are using the web version of Teams in Chrome this is your plug-in.  Head over to <a href="https://github.com/emaas/compact-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github </a>and load up the extension.  A lot of work to be done here but the possibilities are endless!

**Cloud Video Interop has Grown Up!**

If you have legacy VTC units from Cisco, Tandberg, Lifesize, etc. then you want to check out the new options of CVI.  You can catch the session at Ignite about it.  <a href="http://www.polycom.com/forms/realconnect-trial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polycom Real Connect</a> is <a href="https://pexip.com/products/infinity-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pexip&#8217;s Infinity</a> are available today.  Bluejeans will be playing in the sandbox as well.  Polycom is cloud only.  Pexip includes options to install Edge Nodes on-premises which might be HUGE for super-large, complex organizations.

**Pushing Supportability**

So I&#8217;ll have to figure out how much to post but I figured out how to support Modern Authentication in Skype for Business 2015 or 2019 when you are using it as a multi-tenant solution.  So yeah&#8230;that is crazy cool.
