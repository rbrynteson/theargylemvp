If you have deployed CU1 for Skype for Business, enabled Shared Line Appearance and then looked at your event viewer it most likely looks a lot like this:

So after spending a few weeks with a PSS ticket I can tell you &#8211; in the words of all Novell support pages &#8211; a Cosmetic Issue and will be addressed in the future.  Was told that it won&#8217;t be in CU2 but most likely a roadmap item for CU3.  We all had a belief these messages meant absolutely nothing but good to have it verified by Microsoft.
