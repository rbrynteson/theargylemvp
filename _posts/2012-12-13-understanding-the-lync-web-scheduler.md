So if you have visited the Lync Client page on TechNet you will see some new options and I think it&#8217;s a good to look at some of these options.

<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398996.aspx>

Of course there are the normal clients that we all know about.  Lync 2013, Lync Web App and of course the new Lync Windows Store App.  These are fantastic options however there is one that need to be called out because they give you a great new option.

Lync Web Scheduler.  You might be asking yourself, didn&#8217;t we have a Web Scheduler in Lync 2010, and we did but it wasn&#8217;t that great.  Now we (kinda) have a new Web Scheduler.  This tool will allow you to do quite a bit.  Let&#8217;s take a look at it.

So this should look pretty darn familiar.  Go ahead and login with your corporate credentials.

Here you can create a new meeting, set access and presenters and even participants

**New Meeting**

[<img class="alignnone wp-image-101 size-medium" title="pic4" src="https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.gcmtotalsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/pic4-300x233.png?resize=300%2C233&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="233" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/pic4.png?resize=300%2C233&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/pic4.png?w=488&ssl=1 488w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/files/2012/12/pic4.png)

Here you can see my new meeting URL.  I should note here that I&#8217;m using option B for my simple URL&#8217;s (mine are meet.thegaragelab.info/ID and meet.thegaragelab.info/Dialin &#8211; why, because I&#8217;m trying to keep my cert count low).

**Review Existing Meetings**

[<img class="alignnone wp-image-102 size-medium" title="pic5" src="https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.gcmtotalsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/pic5-300x173.png?resize=300%2C173&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="173" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/pic5.png?resize=300%2C173&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/pic5.png?resize=768%2C444&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/pic5.png?w=1019&ssl=1 1019w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/files/2012/12/pic5.png)

As you can see, we can review our existing meetings, join directly from here and do a lot more.

This is a great tool for those who don&#8217;t have access to Outlook (or 2013 OWA Integration), maybe aren&#8217;t using Exchange/Outlook or just on the road at a different computer.

Now, at the start of the start of this post, I said we &#8220;kinda&#8221; have a new feature.  Why did I say that, because Microsoft didn&#8217;t make it easy to get to this feature.  Maybe this will change in an update but as right now we the default URL is:

https://lws.domain.com/scheduler

Now in a lot of companies, this URL might be an absolute mess and something that users might not be able to remember really easily.  Well, thankfully for you we have PowerShell and can define new Simple URL&#8217;s.  So what if we wanted to use https://scheduler.domain.com/.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">First off, lets look and see what we have for Simple URL&#8217;s already defined in our environment:</span>

_$a=Get-CsSimpleUrlConfiguration_  
_$a.SimpleUrl_

This should output something like this:

_PS C:Usersrbrynteson> $A=Get-CsSimpleUrlConfiguration_  
_PS C:Usersrbrynteson> $a.SimpleUrl_

_SimpleUrlEntry : {Url=https://meet.thegaragelab.info/dialin}_  
_Component : Dialin_  
_Domain : *_  
_ActiveUrl : https://meet.thelab.info/dialin_

_SimpleUrlEntry : {Url=https://lyncadmin.thegaragelab.info}_  
_Component : Cscp_  
_Domain : *_  
_ActiveUrl : https://lyncadmin.thelab.info_

_SimpleUrlEntry : {Url=https://meet.thegaragelab.info/ID}_  
_Component : Meet_  
_Domain : thegaragelab.info_  
_ActiveUrl : https://meet.thegaragelab.info/ID_

(Remember &#8211; using option B and you can see that here)

<span style="text-decoration: underline">So let&#8217;s add a new Simple URL.  We have three simple commands:</span>

_$urlEntry = New-CsSimpleUrlEntry -Url &#8220;https://scheduler.thegaragelab.info&#8221;_  
_$simpleUrl = New-CsSimpleUrl -Component &#8220;WebScheduler&#8221; -Domain &#8220;*&#8221; -SimpleUrlEntry $urlEntry -ActiveUrl &#8220;https://scheduler.thegaragelab.info&#8221;_  
_Set-CsSimpleUrlConfiguration -SimpleUrl @{Add=$simpleUrl} -Verbose_

Here we identify a new Simple URL entry and the Simple URL itself.  Then we use the Set-CsSimpleUrlConfiguration to add that new URL to our topology.  If you make a mistake, change the Add=$simpleUrl to Remove=$simpleUrl and try it again.

There is one more step that needs to be completed.  You need to go back to your front-end servers and re-run the bootstrapper process.  This will update your URL Rewrite of IIS on that server.

[<img class="alignnone wp-image-103 size-medium" title="pic6" src="https://i1.wp.com/masteringlync.gcmtotalsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/pic6-300x28.png?resize=300%2C28&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="28" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/pic6.png?resize=300%2C28&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/pic6.png?w=735&ssl=1 735w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/files/2012/12/pic6.png)

Lastly &#8211; you might be asking.  Can the web scheduler send out meeting notices for us?  I haven&#8217;t found a config file yet that allows me to define that information like the old 2010 version but I&#8217;ll continue to look for it.

NOTE: If you had the public preview installed and upgraded from it to RTM &#8211; you may have gotten the Simple URL&#8217;s already defined.  Make sure to check that out.

UPDATE: Two good items of notes that came along as part of the comments.

First &#8211; re-running bootstrapper.  When you make changes to your simple URL&#8217;s you need to go back and rerun the bootstrapper process.  This can be done either through the deployment wizard (Step #2) or you can running bootstrapper.exe from the program fileslyncdeployment folder.

Second &#8211; As pointed out, if you are going to add scheduler.domain.com format you will need to go back and re-request your certificates on the front-end server (and potentially for the reverse proxy if not using a wildcard).  You can do that via the deployment wizard (Step #3) and get an updated certificate.  You can add as many names as you like into that certificate, so feel free to go nuts if you want.
