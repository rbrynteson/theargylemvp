Today was the [MN Office 365 Users Group](https://mn365.org/) meeting and I had the honor to talk about being a Microsoft Teams Meeting Champion.  During the [presentation](https://theargylemvp.com/assets/pptx/MNO365-August-2019.pptx) we reviewed a bunch of demostrations and more.  But I wanted to give a quick outline to those who might download the before mentioned deck with some guidance.

## Level Set

All too often people overlook the different types of meetings.  Each has a specific purpose within an organization and not understanding why you might want to schedule a meeting in one particular way verses another can be difficult.  So in the first section we discussed Scheduled vs Channel vs Ad-Hoc meetings.  And because it is fun, we threw in the fourth type, Live Events because it is a type of meeting just very different.

## The Demo

Here we go through the mechanics of the meeting.  Here is the general outline I followed:

Pre-Meeting
- Chat
- Files
- Meeting Options
- Limitation (Meeting Guest)
..* If had a guest account, then could use that instead
..* Do not see the thread, even after they joined

During Meeting
- Blur
- Recording
- Meeting Options
- Chat
- Live Captions
- Whiteboard
..* No whiteboard for guests either!
- Share (Including System Audio)
- Notes
..* Guests can not see meeting notes during
- Meeting Companion with Mobile Client

Post Meeting
- Chat
- Files
- File Recording

## What is New

Here we just reviewed what was demonstrated at Enterprise Connect, updated on Users Voice and other items that I knew we could discuss.
