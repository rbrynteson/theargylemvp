So I&#8217;ve been promising to answer a bunch of random questions people have been sending so here goes. If you have a question and want to have it answered feel free to post it as a comment or e-mail me.

Q. How is the Skype/Lync Users experience to join Teams Meetings? Stuart

A. Overall it&#8217;s a good experience depending on the browser that the user has as a default browser. Since most users have Chrome as their default browser, this can cause some issues if they do not already have Teams installed. They will not have all of the features like video and ability to share a desktop. Of course, if they have the Teams client installed than all of this isn&#8217;t an issue.

Q. Love all of the client settings. Is there a way we can make changes to all of the XML objects in office wide change? Paul

A. Unfortunately no, when items are stored in the XML files they are encoded in the SQL database. It&#8217;s a bit difficult to mass-edit across the entire SQL database.

Q. Why argyle? Dan

A. Because there is nothing cooler looking than 1990&#8217;s argyle. Why not is my question.

Q. Do you still use Unifi Products? Steall

A. Yep, it&#8217;s still absolutely the best home networking gear I&#8217;ve ever used.

Q. Do you think Exchange VM Unified Messaging announcement actually going to impact customers? No one uses VM anymore do they? Bob45

A. Absolutely. There are so many different companies that have large segments of their business that still revolves around voicemail. Of course, we would love to believe that no one ever picks up a phone and calls in but there are plenty. Yes, if all customers were office bound only employees than the lack of PSTN dial-in might not be an issue but unfortunately we don&#8217;t live in a perfect world.
