Remember when Microsoft Teams came out and I made a bold statement that eventually, we would see all of the features of SfB make their way to Teams.  Well, we are a few more steps closer.

**What&#8217;s New**

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Compose Box</span>

First, the compose box has gotten a fresh new look.  Now instead of trying to find everything (attach, GIF, etc) under one button now each has their own.

<a href="https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.gcmtotalsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1368"><img class="wp-image-1368 alignnone" src="https://i1.wp.com/masteringlync.gcmtotalsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/2-300x34.png?resize=600%2C68&#038;ssl=1" alt="2" width="600" height="68" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/2.png?resize=300%2C34&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/2.png?resize=768%2C86&ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/2.png?resize=1024%2C115&ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/2.png?w=1581&ssl=1 1581w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

This just makes the compose process a lot easier to find features.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Markdown Support</span>

More tricks for the compose box.

**add asterisks** to either end of some text to make it bold  
_underscore_ the beginning and end of some text in order to make it italic  
add a tilde before and after your text to strike through  
Add a double pound sign (##) before your text to create a Header  
Type (<span class="caps">URL</span>) to create a hyperlink within a message  
To start a bulleted list, preface your text with an asterisk (*) or a hyphen (-)  
To start a numbered list, preface your text with  
To create a block quote, just add a right-hand bracket (>) before your text  
Even better, our markdown syntax includes support for code:

To add an inline block of code, start and end the block of text you want to add with an \`  
To add a multi-line block of code, preface your text with &#8220;\` and then paste it into your compose box

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Call Transfer/Hold</span>

Yep, you read that right.  Microsoft Teams can now put calls on hold and transfer them to another user.

Here we can see a call in-progress and I have the ability to hold and transfer.  If I click the Transfer button we get a list of folks that are at the top of your chat window along with the ability to search for more people.

<a href="https://i1.wp.com/masteringlync.gcmtotalsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/3.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1369"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1369" src="https://i1.wp.com/masteringlync.gcmtotalsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/3.png?resize=600%2C209&#038;ssl=1" alt="3" width="600" height="209" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/3.png?w=787&ssl=1 787w, https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/3.png?resize=300%2C104&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/3.png?resize=768%2C267&ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

It&#8217;s a blind transfer although you could do what we do in SfB and simply &#8220;chat&#8221; with the person you want to transfer it to before you do that.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">App Features</span>

Under the app settings we have new features including to stop Teams from launching at Windows Login, Open App in Background and on close to keep the app running.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Other Stuff</span>

Presence is fixed, so you will no longer go to yellow away when your mouse isn&#8217;t active within the app (i.e. background app works) and now you can have up to 999 users in a Team.

&nbsp;

So more features make their way over to the newest calling/conferencing/chat tool from Microsoft.  I&#8217;m hanging to my prediction.
