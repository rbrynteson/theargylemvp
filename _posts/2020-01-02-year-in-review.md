It is that time of year to reflect on what has been 2019 and what 2020 will offer.  So in today’s installment of The Argyle MVP, I wanted to look at what happened over the last 365 days.

## Blog Highlights

I find numbers very interesting!  High school and college was dominated my math and statistical analysis classes and when I look back at the blog this year it’s fun to recount some numbers.
The first number is a bad number.  18.  It’s the number of blog posts this year.  A far cry from my goal of 35 I set out the new year with.  I must get into the spirit and start posting more.  One idea I’ve been tossing around is the idea of a series of posts of writing and publishing my first app to the Teams Store.  I started trying to post an app last year but after four months of Teams Store approval process I gave up.  It’s something I need to do this year.
I might need an accountability buddy to force me to get it done!
Another items that is fun to look at is what are the most popular articles on the site.  This one is a bit surprising.  Of the Top 10 articles, the VAST majority are Skype for Business.  Maybe Skype for Business isn’t dead as some would like us to believe.  Here are my top 10.

A few of these are scary to me.  Are there really customers still trying to deploy ARR as a routing method for Skype for Business?  Hopefully, it was just all old SfB Engineers lookup up what in the world this ARR thing is and how to make it go away as fast as possible.
As a side note, who didn’t love TMG!  Such a short life for such a great product.

## Speaking and Users Group Highlights

2019 also brought up some exciting speaking opportunities.  The highlight of the year was speaking at Comms vNext.  It had that old Lync Conference feel but had a great mix of new and “seasoned” engineers.
Also had the opportunity to speak at O365 Users Group IT Admin day on multiple occasions.  And of course, we had six amazing Teams/Skype Users Group meetings in Minneapolis.

The question is, what will 2020 bring?  I hope it allows for more time to blog about the cool ideas that are happening in the community.  That the community continues to grow and become more inclusive of all.

Happy New Year to everyone in the Teams and Skype for Business community. Can’t wait to see what 2020 brings.
