Since my original [post](http://masteringlync.com/2014/02/16/introducing-the-lyncvalidator/) on the <a href="http://lyncvalidator.com" target="_blank">LyncValidator.com</a> there has been a lot of activity and changes to the tool.  Here are just a few items:

**New Design**

Updated design for the modern and mobile world we live in.  (I think a new CEO said something about that.)  Seriously though, the new design works great on mobile phones and will adjust based on the device you are currently on.

**More Options**

We have added the ability to define both Lync Central Sites, next-hop servers and Reverse Proxy information.  These additions are the first step to the ability to import your existing Lync Topology files directly into the application.  We have more work to do on that front before it&#8217;s complete but one step at a time.

**More Validation**

One of the unique features of the tool is the ability to check your deployment after the design (hence the validator) part of the name.  So we have added additional best practices check before you start your deployment and more post-deployment checks of SRV records, OWAS validation and more.

**Visual Deployments**

In the future we hope to be able to create Visio documents right from the website but until than I added a quick visual layout of your sites and pools.

The best part of all of these changes is there is nothing you need to do to migrate your data from the old to the new because we have done all of that for you already.  If you have any feedback I would love to hear.
