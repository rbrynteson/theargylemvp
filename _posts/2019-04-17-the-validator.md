A new product is coming to Microsoft Teams (pending approval in the store): The Validator

A first step in the long journey of bringing all of the best parts of the Skype Validator into Microsoft Teams.

Our first version will bring the Validator Checks into the Teams. In the below screen shot we can see the port check tool being used check if microsoft.com is open on port 443.<figure class="wp-block-image">

On the left you choose the Test Type and on the right you get the results.

We have lots of other items planned including:

  * Saved validation results
  * Ongoing validation checks (scheduled, etc)
  * and much more

Lastly, my goal is to get this to the point where it&#8217;s available on GitHub for the community.
