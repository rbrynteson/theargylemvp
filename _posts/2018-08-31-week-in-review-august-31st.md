So while wondering around The Great MN Get Together (i.e. State Fair) I decided I&#8217;m going to try to be better and post weekly about anything I found newsworthy and interesting as the week goes along.  I&#8217;m also going to open up the mailbox and reply to any questions you might have on the current state of Teams, Skype for Business or anything else you find interesting.  So feel free to e-mail me at richard@masteringlync.com with any thoughts or questions.  So let&#8217;s get through this week.

**Office 365 (Consumer) Just Got An Upgrade  
** 

You don&#8217;t even have to pay an extra dime for it.  I personally use a Office 365 Personal where I can install Office where I can share the subscription with up to 5 people and install on 5 devices.  Now I can share with 6 and install on an unlimited number of devices!  Wow.  Note, you can be actively using only 5 devices at a given time which I&#8217;m sure they are doing via some cloud magic but none-the-less very cool.

**Teams Updates**

So although these technically happened on the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-d7092a6d-c896-424c-b362-a472d5f105de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21st of August</a> given it&#8217;s my first post there are a few cool items.

#1 &#8211; You can now zoom via the CTRL+Scroll or CTRL+= or CTRL+- on the keyboard.  Fancy.

#2 &#8211; Teams on Windows 10 (Redstone 3 or later) will now honor your quiet hours.  Since I&#8217;m in quiet hours 24&#215;7 I&#8217;ll need to adjust some settings.

**Slack CEO is Crazy**

I think it&#8217;s dangerous to be as confident as Mr. Butterfield but in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-08-30/slack-ceo-says-company-should-end-up-as-big-as-microsoft-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg </a>interview he says that they don&#8217;t worry about Microsoft and think they will just as big as them?  Just as big as the Office Team or all of Microsoft?  I&#8217;m looking forward to Slack OS 10 coming to a PC near you.

**Pat Richard is a Machine!**

If you aren&#8217;t using the <a href="https://www.ucunleashed.com/3619" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Set-CsFeatures</a> script you are missing out.  Well Pat has updated his amazing script with lots of goodies including support for Skype for Business Server 2019.  The product isn&#8217;t even out the door and yet Pat has an update for it.

**Missed another MSUC Chat**

I swear Outlook hates me or I can&#8217;t figure out the basics of notifications.  I missed yet another MSUC Chat and it&#8217;s a shame because they are amazing.  If you haven&#8217;t subscribed to the <a href="http://msuc.chat/index.php/2018/08/24/june-microsoft-uc-chat-thursday-30th-august-2018-at-1730-utc-join-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MSUC Chats </a>make sure you do that ASAP.

**Skype Room Systems gets an Update**

If you have SRS out there (first &#8211; go turn off Windows Update and come back and finish reading this) there is an <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Skype-for-Business-Blog/Skype-Room-Systems-v2-4-0-18-0-update-has-been-released/ba-p/239256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> for you in the store.   My favorite of all of the new features is &#8220;Enable ability to fallback from Teams to Skype for Business mode for SIP calls&#8221;.  So when Teams is down go back to SfB.  How about we just stick with SfB?

**Microsoft has a naming problem still**

So apparently Windows 10 Redstone 5 will be named <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/08/31/showcasing-new-computing-possibilities-at-ifa/#UpEyecQUUo0dHmkm.97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows 10 October 2018 Update</a>.  I mean I guess that is better than Windows 1809.  Anyone else think they should just finish stealing names from Apple and go with 10.4 at this point in time.  Would be a lot easier to remember.

Well that is it!  In the future I might just copy/paste IM conversations between myself and McKinney &#8211; @ucomsgeek &#8211; for the world to see.  I&#8217;ll need to make sure I redact a few lines though.
