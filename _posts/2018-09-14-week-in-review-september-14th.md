There are some weeks where it feels like all the new stopped and it&#8217;s one of those weeks.  As Microsoft Ignite draws closer everyone is saving all of their amazing announcements until then.  So what should we talk about today?

**Apple released a new Phone**

Don&#8217;t worry, the top-end phone only costs $1449.  I wonder how many virtual machines I can run on that baby?!?!

**Learn some NAT/STUN/TURN**

If you never got the chance to attend a Microsoft Masters class (and boy did you miss out) then you never got to see a TRUE lecture on NAT/STUN/TURN.  There were awesome ICE ICE BABY moments and much more.   Well you can check out <a href="https://blog.valeconsulting.co.uk/2018/09/11/microsoft-teams-stun-turn-and-nat-get-your-media-right/amp/?__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark&#8217;s blog </a>and get a flavor for it.  But no icebergs moving across the screen.  #SharkWeek #MissThatTest

**API&#8217;s are cool**

Nope, nothing I write (we can talk about that later) but the Graph API can now get a list of all of your Microsoft Teams.  That is pretty cool.  Check out this <a href="https://alexholmeset.blog/2018/09/10/find-all-teams-teams-using-graph-api-and-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post </a>for all the details.

**Users Group Meeting**

If you are in the Minneapolis area on October 18th come check out the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/MinnesotaLyncUserGroup/events/254656114/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MN Skype/Teams Users Group Meeting</a>.  We typically have around 35 to 40 people each meeting.  Lots of fun.

**More Self-Advertising**

If you missed it, get your programming on with the new <a href="https://masteringlync.com/2018/09/13/validator-sdk-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SkypeValidator API&#8217;s</a>.  You can build yourself fancy tools to check common issues.

**Another Chat Product**

So apparently Microsoft has yet another chat product.  No, it&#8217;s not Teams or Skype for Business or MSN Messenger or Skype (Consumer) or Group Me but instead it&#8217;s Kaizala!  What is that.  No clue but apparently @ucomsgeek created a Kaizala <a href="https://t.co/wHlSZwUETy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group/channel/thread/location/persistent chat/room</a> to discuss all things Ignite.  I won&#8217;t be at Ignite this year&#8230;maybe next year&#8230;so I guess we can follow along there.

I turned off notifications&#8230;one moment as I check my phone&#8230;

Good Grief&#8230;there are 94 unread message.  I guess that is it for this weeks update as I need to go read yet another inbox.
