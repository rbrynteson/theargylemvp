Hello everyone – I&#8217;ve decided being here at TechEd I would do a better job of blogging and highlighting stuff that has come up in the past few months.  We are several thousand phones deployed already and learned a ton of things so we should most likely be good and share back to the community.

So here is my first item of the day and will continue to post a bunch more over the next few weeks.

Microsoft has released a bunch of new documentation today and it can all be found here:

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398616.aspx

The highlights to mention are:

  * Videos for Call Quality Troubleshooting
  * Videos for General Troubleshooting
  * QoE and CDR Schema

So make sure to grab the latest docs.  They are amazing and if you take the time to read through the planning guides, you will find it significantly easier to deploy Lync.
