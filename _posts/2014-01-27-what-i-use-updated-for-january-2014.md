I get asked all the time about what headset I prefer, what gateway I prefer, is there a certain tool I use for x, etc.  A few months ago I remember seeing Paul Thurrott post his own &#8220;what I use&#8221; information of hardware and software and I thought, why not do this with Lync.

I&#8217;ll go ahead and update this if anything major changes along the way.

Lastly, note these are all of my own opinion and have nothing to do with my employer.

**Headsets**

I believe I&#8217;m in the minority when it comes to headsets but I really prefer wired headsets over Bluetooth.  There is something about that &#8220;thing&#8221; hanging out of my ear which seems strange.

_Wired Headset_: [Jabra Biz 2400 Duo USB](http://www.jabra.com/Products/Wired_Headsets/Jabra_BIZ__2400__Series/Jabra_BIZ_2400_Duo_USB).  Of all of the wired headsets I&#8217;ve used, I find the Jabra wired headsets to be the most comfortable to use and sounds fantastic.  It offers a very comfortable earpiece &#8230; not sure if it&#8217;s leather or the fake leather but it&#8217;s awesome.

_Wireless Headset_: [Jabra Motion UC](http://www.jabra.com/Products/Wireless_Headsets/Jabra_MOTION_UC_Series/Jabra_MOTION_UC).  When I&#8217;m using a wireless headset this is the one I&#8217;ve turned to most often.  Fits well on my ear and holds a charge for just about forever.

**Desk Phones**

So I have six different phones on my desk but I continue to switch between two different devices all the time.

Polycom CX600: I still believe this is the best desktop phone on the market at this time.  The integration is simple, it works all the time and I never have a problem with it.

Polycom VVX500: This is my secondary desktop device.  I swap out the CX600 and VVX 500 all the time.  I really like the functionality and flexibility of the 500.  I just wish the BTOE software wouldn&#8217;t bring up an error message every time I hit the road with the device.

**Portable Sound**

I love listening to what everyone considers &#8220;crappy pop music&#8221; and when I&#8217;m out and about I use my [Jabra Soulmate](http://www.jabra.com/products/speakers/jabra_solemate/jabra_solemate_black).  What I love about this device is not only does it produce some great sound in small to medium sized rooms, you have both a Bluetooth and 1/8 jack adapter.  This device also has a microphone and although not Lync optimized works as a portable device for Lync conferences.

**Cell Phone**

My current smart phone is a Nokia Lumia 920 running Windows Phone 8.1.  The app gap has gotten smaller and frankly, Cortana is fantastic.  I also have an Apple iPhone 5, iPhone 4S and Nokia 900.

I&#8217;ll add anything else that jumps to mind on the page.
