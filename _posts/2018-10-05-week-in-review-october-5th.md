Another amazing week of updates (and sarcasm) is coming to you live today.  I need to purchase a tape recorder so as the week goes by and I think of funny lines I can take them down.  Or maybe I could use my handheld computer that doubles as a communication device for that. This update has a bit of a Cloud Bent on it.

Well, here goes:

**Blurred lines&#8230;err&#8230;Background Is Live**

My favorite page of all time is the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s-new-in-Microsoft-Teams-d7092a6d-c896-424c-b362-a472d5f105de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teams Update</a> page.  I know a large segment of the IT world absolutely hates the rapid rate of changes in Microsoft Teams when compared to any other product ever released by Microsoft.  But at least all of the content is in a single place unlike everyone else.  Remember Skype for Business Updates?  They would land in a blog, Skype Consumer Blog, TechNet, Tech Communities, twitter&#8230;pretty much anywhere!

**Ignite Is A Wrap!**

I wasn&#8217;t there but it certainly sounds like one amazing party after another.  Oh, and I suppose there was some content at the event as well.  Make sure to head over to the <a href="https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ignite Tech Community</a> pages to see a replay of all sorts of different sessions.  A few of my favorites are:

<a href="https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/65542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRK3124</a>: How SfB can take advantage of Microsoft Teams Meetings.  The idea of a Meetings First approach isn&#8217;t new.  Actually, if you have read my blog previously you would now all the way back in October 2017 I wrote an article about making <a href="https://masteringlync.com/2017/10/16/skype-for-business-microsoft-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teams + Skype for Business work together nicely</a>.  Check out my last paragraph:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1687" src="https://masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MeetingsFirst.png?resize=768%2C63&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="768" height="63" /> 

Hmmm&#8230;.looks familiar!

<a href="https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/65537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRK3229</a>: Everything you need to know about SfB 2019.  In this session we learn that all of those articles predicting the death of SfB Server for the last 12 months were wrong.

**SfB 2019 Updates**

Watch the video I posted above or if you like to read your news check out <a href="http://tomtalks.uk/2018/09/skype-for-business-server-2019-news-from-microsoft-ignite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom&#8217;s</a> blog or <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Skype-for-Business-Ignite-Blog/Ignite-2018-BRK3229-Everything-you-need-to-know-about-Skype-for/ba-p/264448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan&#8217;s Tech Community </a>post about the changes.  Both are great write ups of what is happening.

**Turn Off That NTLM**

If you like security and making things slightly more painful for your users, you now have the ability to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Skype-for-Business-Blog/SfB-Server-Now-Supports-Blocking-NTLM-Externally/ba-p/261696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disable NTLM support</a> externally for Skype for Business.  There are lots of reasons you might not want to do this.  For example, all of those IP Phones you have might rely on NTLM if they connect through the edge.  Just saying!  The <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Skype-for-Business-Blog/SfB-Server-Now-Supports-Blocking-NTLM-Externally/ba-p/261696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docs </a>article also tells you how to turn it off internally as well.  I&#8217;m guessing that might cause a few issues for people.

**Watch Those Scripts**

<a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/cisco-automatically-deleted-vms-hosting-webex-teams-513511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ouch</a>!

**Call Queues and Auto Attendants in Teams**

So I actually noticed this working on Wednesday when I was doing some testing.  But now both <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams-Blog/Answer-Auto-Attendant-and-Call-Queue-calls-directly-from-Teams/ba-p/222382" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CQ and AA </a>can target Teams Only users.  What is super cool is your user population can actually be split in three different ways.  I have a CQ with users Teams Only, SfB Online and SfB On-Premises.  Now that is cool.

**Language!**

I guess someone had a bad experience on Skype for Business.

**Microsoft rolling out Teams add-in?**

Huh?  Haven&#8217;t we all had this in our Outlook for nearly a year now?  Microsoft is just now <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/itshowcase/blog/microsoft-teams-meeting-add-in-spurs-move-away-from-skype-for-business-inside-microsoft/?_lrsc=9d35dda8-eed6-4757-a8ea-4b7e1efe0c13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolling </a>it out to its own employees.  Here is my favorite line:

&#8220;As soon as it gets tested on a large scale, the company will start the shift to Teams from Skype for Business for all internal communications.&#8221;

So have we all been the Microsoft Test Center for the past 16 months?
