Microsoft has slipped out a bunch of changes into the Modern Portal and we will dive into each of those updates but a big one for lots of enterprise customers is the ability to mark Audio, Video and Screen Sharing traffic.  Good news, it&#8217;s in the portal now.

If you go to Meetings | Meeting Settings you will see:

The settings are really straight forward and what you would expect for a modern product.  By default, the QoS markers are disabled for the client.  So first you need to check the box to turn them on.  Once you have done that, you will get the option to select the port ranges you want to use.  The defaults are the same as Skype for Business Online.
