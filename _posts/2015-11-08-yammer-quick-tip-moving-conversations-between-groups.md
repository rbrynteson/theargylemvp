You didn&#8217;t read that title wrong!  This is a post about Yammer on the Mastering Lync (err..Skype for Business) blog.  You might be asking, why?  Because this is really about Unified Communications in general (hence the Exchange and sometimes random Azure posts).

**Issue:** For the organizational freaks like me Yammer might drive you nuts.  My inbox in Outlook is used as my &#8220;to-do&#8221; list so if it&#8217;s ever over 30 e-mails I start to go nuts.  I call ourselves filers as opposed to the piler out there and Yammer violates everything there is about being a filer.

About two weeks ago I decided that I would spend everyday in Yammer as I learn how it works and try to use it for some real purposes and one thing continues to bother me A LOT!  People who post in the wrong group!

So let&#8217;s see what this looks like.

Here we have a thread in my private group of coaches corner but it should have really been in another group.

**Solution:** The solution is pretty easy actually.  Click on Share at the top more level and choose the new group you want it to be shared into.  (See the red box above for where it is.)

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1210" src="https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.gcmtotalsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/2.png?resize=527%2C484&#038;ssl=1" alt="2" width="527" height="484" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/2.png?w=527&ssl=1 527w, https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/2.png?resize=300%2C276&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.gcmtotalsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/2.png)

Once it&#8217;s shared, you will see it in the other group.

A few notes I learned:

#1 &#8211; If you go and delete the original item it will remain in the shared location (this is cool from a user perspective, a potential nightmare from an admin perspective).

#2 &#8211; You can share information from a private group into a public group (and it doesn&#8217;t even warn you it&#8217;s going to do that &#8211; that one is scary).
