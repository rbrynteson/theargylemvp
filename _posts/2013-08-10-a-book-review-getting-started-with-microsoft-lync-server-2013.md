So over the past year I have gotten all sorts of random requests to review books, blog posts and all sorts of random content.  Typically I just ignore the requests and move on with my day but a couple weeks ago I said yes to reviewing &#8220;Getting Started with Microsoft Lync Server 2013&#8221; by Fabrizio Volpe.  The print or eBook can be found <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-microsoft-lync-server-2013/book" target="_blank">here</a>.

First off, lets explain what this book isn&#8217;t.  If you are looking for a book to help you troubleshoot your edge deployment, design your 50+ server worldwide Lync Server deployment or understand the details of how ICE/STUN/TURN works than you should go ahead and skip this book.  This is not to say this is a bad book but rather a book designed for those who are new to Lync Server 2010 or Lync Server 2013.  If you have never deployed Lync before and you need to deploy a lab or a small deployment of Lync, the tutorials in this book will help you get from a base OS to a server running Lync Server 2013.  If you are an experienced Lync 2010 administrator this book has some interesting nuggets (small section on Enterprise Voice, a little bit about VDI, Persistent Chat) that you might find helpful but you will need to decide if that information is worth the money vs doing a Bing search to find much of the same information.

There are a few things in particular that I like about this book.  First, the book isn&#8217;t written as a &#8220;formal book&#8221; but rather it reads like a really long blog post &#8211; or a series of blog posts.  I like that writing style as typically it is easier to read and relate to the author.  Second, this book does a better job than TechNet does on the actual install process.  Although TechNet has gotten better over the past few years I feel like they 1) fail to include screenshots when they should 2) assume you are creating a 12 server enterprise pool all the time.  Lastly, this book does a nice job of including the correct references to TechNet and other MVP blog posts where necessary.

So in conclusion, if you are new to Lync and need a book to help walk you through a lab deployment or understand the basics of the product, this book will certainly help you with that.

NOTE: I wasn&#8217;t paid or compensated for this review other than a copy of the eBook to review.
