What is my job now?  To be honest I am no longer sure.  Recently a friend of mine is looking to move from one IT position to another.  He has a background in IT so he has heard about Microsoft Teams but has not played with it specifically.  But believes that there is an opportunity for growth in his company if he jumps onto this bandwagan.  So the question was: what do I need to know to manage Teams?

When I started thinking about this this picture summed up my thoughts.

Teams is a collection of a million pieces so you need to know just about everything in the Office 365 stack to be good.  But what does that mean since it keeps getting bigger and bigger.  What is helpful is fellow MVP Jonathan McKinney wrote a [blog article](http://blog.ucomsgeek.com/2014/08/so-you-want-to-be-lync-architect.html) long ago about what it meant to be a Lync Architect.  So starting with his content I decided to create what it means to manage Teams.

Since there is no such thing as a Teams Administrator and no company is most likely hiring for this postion yet.  Individuals are going to be coming to Microsoft Teams from somewhere else, like Skype for Business or SharePoint.  Further more, there might be a whole host of admins who will be coming from a non-Microsoft world.  Maybe they are coming from Slack, Chime or Zoom.  So what do I need to know to be good at my job.  So I started with the list from Jonathan and added to it.  I also followed his format because it made lots of sense in my head.

## Hard Skills

This is going to be a long list.  I will try to organize the list in a way that makes sense.  But obivously you cannot and will not be an expert in every area.  But the more you know the more you know the more you have.  Some of these items are may not apply to your organization.  For example, if you do not plan on doing PSTN Calling in Teams, all of the telephony stuff does not matter.  Likewise, if you do not have to migrate users from Skype for Business to Teams then you do not need to know it even existed previously.

#### Identity
- Active Directory
- Azure AD Connect

#### Desktop
- Windows 7/10
- Desktop Deployment Software
- Office 365 - Outlook

#### Office 365
- SharePoint
- Yammer
- Office 365 Groups
- Stream
- Skype for Business Online
- Security & Compliance
- Governance & Lifecycle

#### Admin Tools
- PowerShell
- MS Graph

#### Network
- Layer 2 Networking (Switched)
- Layer 3 Networking (Routed)
- IPv4
- IPv6
- TCP/IP
- Quality of Service
- Firewalls
- Network Sniffer (Wireshark, Message Analyzer)
- Audio Codecs (G.711 etc)
- HTTP/HTTPS

#### Telephony
- SIP
- SBC
- PRI

And obviously there are sub-sets of information under each of these categories.  In Azure AD Groups you better know about Guest management, how to add, remove accounts and much more.  If you something I missed feel free to drop a comment below or hit me up on twitter.

## Soft Skills

So at this point in time Jonathan goes through a list of soft skills.  These are all honestly going to be the same.  Some of these might be specific to a consultant whereas others are needed in every job.  

- Good listening skills
- Good presentation skills
- Good communications skills (verbal and written)
- Patience
- Attitude toward constant learning
- Self starter
- Working in teams

## Get There

So how does one get all of these skills.  Obviously there are lots of Microsoft docs that can lead you in a direction.  There are local User Group communities, big conferences like Ignite (happening next week) and much more.
