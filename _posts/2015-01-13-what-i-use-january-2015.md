  - What I Use
---
It&#8217;s been nearly a year since I&#8217;ve done a &#8220;what I use&#8221; article.  My inspiration for this concept is from Paul Thurrott&#8217;s.  I find his article interesting and given the daily e-mails about &#8220;what do you use here&#8221; I thought I would write one up again.  As always, if you have questions use the commends or richard@masteringlync.com.

My previous article can be found [here](http://masteringlync.com/2014/01/27/what-i-use-updated-for-january-2014/) and comes nearly one year later.  I would also like to note that nearly everything you find on this list I pay for to use.  If there is an exception, I&#8217;m happy to note it.

Lastly, these are my own thoughts and not those of my employer.

**Headsets**

This last year has been an experiment of several different headsets but I found myself always coming back to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Optimized-Corded-Headset-Softphone/dp/B0028RD02I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1421157951&sr=8-1&keywords=jabra+2400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jabra BIZ 2400</a> USB Duo.  Why?  Because they sound fantastic and after nearly two years of use they haven&#8217;t broke.  You can still find these online and for less than $125.00 in most cases.  An absolute steal!

But that all changed a few weeks ago when Jabra sent me a demo pair of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Environmental-Microphone-Communications-Softphones/dp/B00Q7AR69U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1421158126&sr=8-1&keywords=evolve+80+lync" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evolve 80</a> Headset.  To say these have changed my habits of Lync is absolutely true.  The Advanced Noise Cancellation and sound quality are simply amazing.  They are so nice that since I&#8217;ve had them, I&#8217;ve already bought two other pairs of them, one for my wife who is a Director in Tupperware and on her computer all the time and my daughter who spends more time on Hangouts than any person I&#8217;ve met.  They simply are that great!  Some people have complained that they are a bit tight on their head and I could potentially see that but I think I&#8217;m wearing them 4 to 5 hours a day right now.  Hopefully the build quality is as good as the 2400&#8217;s.

My on the go headset is switched back and forth between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-Voyager-Bluetooth-Optimized-Microsoft/dp/B00BMBZB3M/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1421158415&sr=8-3&keywords=plantronics+voyager+lync" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plantronics Voyager Legend</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jabra-MOTION-UC-MS-Headset/dp/B00GAGHB5K/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1421158465&sr=8-5&keywords=jabra+uc+motion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jabra MOTION</a>.  I get a bit better range for whatever reason with my MOTION than I do the Legend in my home so if I&#8217;m wireless I seem to default to that device more often &#8211; but honestly &#8211; since I&#8217;ve gotten my Evolve 80&#8217;s I can&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;ve used either of these devices.

**Desk Phones**

All sorts of controversy of who has the best desk phone for Lync.  Let me start by saying I would guess that less than 5% of all calls are made via a desk phone now (most likely even less than that).

My default device is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Polycom-CX600-Phone-2200-15987-025-220015987025/dp/B005CW8TCW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1421158664&sr=8-2&keywords=Polycom+CX600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polycom CX600</a>.  This device simply works!  There is no other way to describe it.  Yes, it doesn&#8217;t have all the features of an 3PIP phones but if I want to just take something out of the box and use it, this is the device to go to.

I still have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Polycom-PY-2200-44600-001-16-line-Phone-Supply/dp/B00PWUU33W/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1421158764&sr=8-7&keywords=Polycom+VVX600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VVX600</a> and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/NEW-snom-821-Phone-VoIP/dp/B004Y39KZU/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1421158815&sr=8-6&keywords=SNOM+821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SNOM 821</a> on my desk as well.  These devices are there solely for testing different things.  I still believe in my heart that the VVX600 will overtake the CX600 &#8211; it&#8217;s just one or two firmware updates away I believe.

**Portable Sound**

Nothing has changed here since the last update.  I use my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jabra-SOLEMATE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Portable/dp/B008R523N2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1421158902&sr=8-1&keywords=Jabra+Soulmate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jabra Soulmate</a> all the time when listening to my music around the house or on the road.  This is definitely one area that I&#8217;m going to look into for 2015 because I need a better in home audio solution.

**Mobile Phone**

I&#8217;m still one of 12 people who use Windows Phone.  My daily phone is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-920-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B00AR23T5O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1421159039&sr=8-1&keywords=Nokia+920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nokia 920</a>.  For me the combination of Wireless Charging, NFC Payments and the apps I use are perfect.  If I&#8217;m traveling with the family, I swap SIM&#8217;s and use a Nokia 1020 because the camera is AMAZING.  The camera &#8220;hump&#8221; is just a bit annoying to carry in the pocket all the time but all in all it&#8217;s a great device.

I have an iPhone 5S for testing and a Nokia 900 (although testing Windows 7.x is pretty meaningless now).

**Tablet/Computer**

I bought into the &#8220;tablet that can replace your laptop&#8221; before it became that.  My daily computer is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-128GB-Windows/dp/B00FG7MVJU/ref=sr_1_3?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1421159473&sr=1-3&keywords=Surface+Pro+2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surface Pro 2 / 128 GB</a>.  I have that connected to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Docking-Station-Surface-Pro/dp/B00N3J9QCS/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1421159522&sr=1-1&keywords=Surface+Pro+2+Dock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surface Pro 2 Docking Station</a> and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Plugable-UD-3900-SuperSpeed-Universal-2560x1440/dp/B00ECDM78E/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1421159587&sr=1-2&keywords=USB+Pluggable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USB Pluggable UD-3900</a> docking station.  This setup gives me three monitors at my desk.  That computer is connect to three Dell 24 inch monitors.

The Surface becomes my daily tablet when I hit the road.  I also have a MacBook Pro 13 inch to use a test machine for any Mac OS X work I need to do.
