Wow, can you believe it!  I made it two weeks in a row and making weekly updates and there is actually stuff to talk about as well.  Who would have thought that was possible.

**Office is getting a Make-Over**

If you are using Office 2016 and you are in the Office Insiders Fast ring you will notice that EVERYTHING looks different!  If you are using a Corporate Account for Office 365 you can head over <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-office-365-commercial-customers-can-get-early-access-to-new-office-features-4dd8ba40-73c0-4468-b778-c7b744d03ead?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here </a>to learn how to get yourself into the Insider Ring.  If you are using consumer, it&#8217;s a drop down.

I remember way back in Office 2007 when they introduced the ribbon.  At the time I was working at a school district and was responsible for training the nearly 2000 staff members on how it worked and it was a MAJOR deal.  Although not as major, this is going to be another change to customers so I hope the training departments are ready.  Here is a screenshot from Outlook 2016 for example:

<img class="alignnone wp-image-1595 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/NewOutlook.png?resize=800%2C159&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="159" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/NewOutlook.png?resize=1024%2C204&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/NewOutlook.png?resize=300%2C60&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/NewOutlook.png?resize=768%2C153&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/NewOutlook.png?w=1600&ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/NewOutlook.png?w=2400&ssl=1 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

That is certainly a &#8220;simplified&#8221; version of the ribbon.  Word, Excel and PowerPoint don&#8217;t have the simplified ribbon but I&#8217;m sure they are next.  After using it for a few days, I like it!

**Syncing Security Groups with Team Membership**

If you missed it, Teams Team leader Dan Stevenson posted a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams-Blog/Syncing-Security-Groups-with-team-membership/ba-p/241959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super-interesting article</a> on how to synchronize the membership between security group and Office 365 groups.  It pains me that this is still a thing and I&#8217;m sure someday they will be one in the same.

**&#8220;Meet Now&#8221; with Microsoft Teams**

Microsoft posted a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams-Blog/Meet-Now-with-Microsoft-Teams/ba-p/237029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great article</a> about the completion of several key meeting capability in the Skype for Business to Teams Roadmap.  They focus on the pre-meeting, during meeting, post-meeting experience, federated meetings and more.

Funny, the only thing that isn&#8217;t in article is to announce that Teams has a &#8220;Meet Now&#8221; feature like Skype for Business.  I really need to be able to  create an ad-hoc meeting, and invite anyone from any team to it and go.  Well, maybe in the next &#8220;Meet Now&#8221; article will detail that.

**Click the URL, join a team**

Teams picks up one of the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s-new-in-Microsoft-Teams-d7092a6d-c896-424c-b362-a472d5f105de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most requested </a>and feared features.  You can now send out links to a specific team and when people click on it they join (or go into a pending state to join).  I look forward to all of the SfB IM&#8217;s with Teams Team URL&#8217;s in it.

**Magic Quadrant is coming for you!**

Everyone loves a good <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-5EXL4OW&ct=180906&st=sb&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic Quadrant</a>.  Well, no shock but Microsoft made the Meetings Magic Quadrant and not only that it&#8217;s a three way race between Zoom, Cisco and Microsoft.  I&#8217;m a bit shocked by how high Zoom is but maybe their super-simple-few-features Meeting experience is what people are looking for.  Something that just works.  I&#8217;ll be honest, first time I heard the name Zoom I thought it was a new car from Mazda.

**Skype for Business is Dead?**

Well, according to an e-mail I received from AVST it is.  &#8220;With Microsoft saying &#8216;goodbye&#8217; to Unified Messaging &#8230; and the news that Skype for Business Server 2019 will be its final release&#8221;.    I wonder, is it possible to say a product is on it&#8217;s final version and yet continue to update it with new features every few months \*cough\* Windows 10 \*cough\* to meet the needs of the market.  I wonder.
