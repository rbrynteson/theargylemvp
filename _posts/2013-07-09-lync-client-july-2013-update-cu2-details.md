There were several new features added as part of CU2/July Security Patch &#8211; http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39555.  The following is a rundown of those new features.

**Meeting Join from the Lync Client**

In addition to joining meeting from Outlook, users can now join meeting directly from the Lync 2013 CU2 Client.  The meetings tab will display all calendar appointments for the current day.  Any internal online meetings will be displayed in blue and can be joined by either double-clicking or right-clicking on the meeting.

**Question/Answer Feature**

One of the features that was available in Live Meeting 2007 was a Q&A section where users/attendees could ask questions and presenters were able to answer those questions.  The results were able to be saved to an external file for later use.

In Lync Server 2013 CU2, this feature has been restored with within the meeting feature.  To use the feature do the following:

  1. From within any meeting (either scheduled or ad-hoc/meet now).  Hover over the present button.  Here you will see a new option for Q&A.

  1. After choosing Q&A you will see the presentation stage appear with the new Q & A manager.

It is important to note a few rules of using the Q&A Manager.

  1. When Q&A is being used, the group IM feature is disabled for all participants.
  2. All users are able to ask questions and see the answers to questions.  Only presenters are able to answer questions.

**Instant Messaging Mute**

There are times that during an audio or video conference call you may want to disable the IM feature of the product.  Lync Server 2013 CU2 introduces IM Mute.  Any presenter during a meeting can enable/disable IM mute.  To use this feature:

  1. From within any meeting (either scheduled or ad-hoc/meet now).  Hover over the people button and select Actions.  Here you will see an option for IM Mute.

  1. Once a meeting is muted, all users within the meeting are notified that IM&#8217;s are no longer allowed.

Additionally, when creating a meeting from the Outlook Client, an option in the Meeting Options pain allows the same functionality to be enabled.

**Inline Pictures within IM Window**

A common feature found in competing IM products is the ability to copy/paste pictures directly into the IM window.  This is also a new feature of the Lync 2013 CU2 Client.  To use this feature, simply paste a picture into an IM session.

<a href="http://masteringlync.com/2013/07/09/lync-client-july-2013-update-cu2-details/pic4-5/" rel="attachment wp-att-337"><img class="alignnone wp-image-337 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.gcmtotalsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/pic41.png?resize=429%2C582&#038;ssl=1" alt="pic4" width="429" height="582" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/pic41.png?w=429&ssl=1 429w, https://i2.wp.com/masteringlync.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/pic41.png?resize=221%2C300&ssl=1 221w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

The user on the far side is able to see/open/save the picture directly from the IM window.
