Everyone likes FREE!  Microsoft [announced](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/microsoft-is-putting-slack-on-notice/ar-AAzY5Iz) today that a free tier of Teams is now available.  This isn&#8217;t a huge shock as it&#8217;s been rumored for [months](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17057270/microsoft-teams-free-version-slack-competition).  But it&#8217;s good to see the offer finally announced.  Many will tell you it&#8217;s an amazing offer and honestly, it is.  This is going to increase Microsoft&#8217;s reach into more and more organizations, assuming they can get people away from Slack.  That is where the real problem is.  For organizations that already use slack they need a reason to migrate.  The &#8220;Free&#8221; version of Teams gives you lots of reasons:

  * Unlimited App integrations (Slack Free is limited to 10)
  * Group Calling (Slack Free is limited to 1:1 Only)
  * Screen Sharing (Slack Free doesn&#8217;t offer this)
  * Unlimited Searching (Slack Free is limited to the last 10,000 messages)
  * More storage.  10 GB Team + 2 GB User (Slack Free is limited to 5 GB for the entire team/users)
  * Search across channels, people, files (Slack Free doesn&#8217;t offer this)
  * Guest Access (Slack Free doesn&#8217;t offer this but you can just make anyone a Slack user so it&#8217;s a bit of a silly item to note)

So that is A LOT of Free above what Slack is going to offer.  The key is how do we get people moved from Slack to Teams.  I think there are still a handful of roadblocks Microsoft needs to figure out including:

  * Faster/better guest access
  * Faster client
  * Channel permissions

These are the three big things a Slack user would &#8220;miss&#8221; if they migrated.  And, all of their data!  There is still no tool for Slack to Teams migrations.  I wonder if the limitation is on the Slack side or the MS Teams side.  So if anyone is reading and interested in helping in a programming tool, lets see if we can build one.  Maybe community built, maybe paid.  Who knows what might come of it.  Next week I&#8217;ll spend some time looking at what can be pulled from Slack.
