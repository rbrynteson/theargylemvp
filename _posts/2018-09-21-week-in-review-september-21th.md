So much for a slow week!Â  When it rains, it pours out.Â  Apparently there is SO MUCH to announce at Ignite that a bunch of stuff is hitting this week&#8230;well&#8230;just a few things.

**Going To Ignite?**

If you are going to Ignite make sure to check out <a href="http://blog.ucomsgeek.com/2018/08/tips-and-tricks-unofficial-party-and.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ucomesGeek blog post</a> about how to select sessions, where the parties are and much much more.

The post also details a prize for taking a selfie with those behind the amazing CommsvNext Event!Â  Good news, I didn&#8217;t need to take a selfie as I already had a picture taken with them.

**You are an Admin!Â  You are an Admin!Â  You are an Admin!**

Now you can have your Oprah moment and make everyone an admin for Microsoft Teams.Â  This week it was announced that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/using-admin-roles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Admin Roles</a> have landed for Microsoft Teams.Â  This gives admin&#8217;s some flexibility in terms of what is and isn&#8217;t allowed for an admin.Â  There are some gaps in the current four option mode so hopefully we get a few more down the road.

**Skype for Business Updates&#8230;on the Mac**

If you are a Mac User there is an <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/follow-the-latest-updates-in-skype-for-business-cece9f93-add1-4d93-9a38-56cc598e5781?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US#OS_Type=Mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update </a>for you so you can support the recently released Mojave (10.14) release.Â  What is really cool about this is a new Meetings-Only app that will be used for organizations as they migrate from Skype for Business to Teams.

**Exchange Voicemail + PBX&#8230;Back From The Grave**

This one just slipped under the radar and no one really said much about it.Â  But the date for the <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2018/04/24/new-date-for-discontinuation-of-support-for-session-border-controllers-in-exchange-online-unified-messaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discontinuation of legacy SBC</a> to Exchange UM has been moved back to December 1st, 2019.Â  Let&#8217;s see if this date moves again.Â  I doubt it will.

**Greig has too much time on his hands!Â  ðŸ™‚**

Actually this is super cool.Â  Fellow MVP Greig Sheridan (@greiginsydney) has taken the WiFi enabled VVX phone to another level.Â  He taken a battery pack and created a <a href="https://greiginsydney.com/a-battery-powered-vvx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wireless VVX Phon</a>e with WiFi.

**More API&#8217;s**

The Hoff &#8230;aka Ken Lasko&#8230; has created an API for the <a href="http://ucken.blogspot.com/2018/09/skype-optimizer-json-api.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skype Optimizer</a>.Â  This is nifty and has all sorts of potential.Â  Imagine you could write a PowerShell script to auto-update your SfB Environment weekly.Â  I wonder how I could integrate this with the Skype Validator?Â  I&#8217;ll need to think about that.Â  Or maybe I should go register his domain from him instead.

**Top Golf Come to Minnesota**

No one will care about this except for me but <a href="https://topgolf.com/us/minneapolis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top Golf</a> has come to Minnesota.Â  I have no clue how it will work when it&#8217;s -15 degree &#8211; that is fahrenheit &#8211; but it doesn&#8217;t matter because I&#8217;ll still be on the range!Â  Speaking of which, need to wrap up this post.Â  Need to head to a Top Golf Grand Opening party right now!
